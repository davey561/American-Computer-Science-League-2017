# American-Computer-Science-League-2017
This repository includes all of my programs written for the American Computer Science League in 2017 (my junior year) as a member of my high school's computer science team. Each assignment is standardized so that the program takes in an input of 5 or 6 lines and outputs 5 lines of data exactly.

The first program, written in January, predicts the first move that the dealer player would make in an obscure card game called Agram

The second program, written in February, rearranges a sequence of digits in a specificed pattern.

The third program, written in March, determines the square on a board that had to be pressed in a game of Lights Out to transition from the composition of an initial 8-by-8 board to the resulting 8-by-8 board, which are encoded in a collection hexadecimal of input lines.
